Test
=========

* Create a container environment using Docker Compose to serve a static page grabbed from the hostâ€™s disk.
* Set up the containers to serve the page.
* Setup a provisioner-managed database server in the container.
* Add a statistics page in the scripted language of your choice. Loading a page will grab information about the database server (existing databases and users).
* All containers have to be in one Docker compose file.
* Put your provisioner files up into the Git Toptal repository.
* Deploy this setup to a cloud provider using an automation tool like Kubernetes/Terraform/another.

# Terraform

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

```
ssh core@x.x.x.x
```

# Webpages at:

## Static file

## database list and users
```
curl localhost:5000
curl localhost:5000/users
```

# Thoughts
This is definitely hacky.  I didn't spend the time to make this a real world example.  I basically took some stuff I found on the internet and stuff that I had and started to combine it together as fast as I can to satify the requirements.
